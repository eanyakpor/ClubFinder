## Project Overview
During the SOSE Hackathon 2025, our team noticed a common challenge for CSUN students: staying connected with campus clubs and events is often confusing and time-consuming. The existing platform, MataSync, is outdated, missing key details, and does not provide an easy way for students to see what clubs are active or when events happen. Students with busy schedules, including work, commuting, and academics, often struggle to find opportunities that fit their time and interests.

To address this, we developed **Club Connect**, a web platform that makes discovering, joining, and participating in clubs simple and convenient. It centralizes all club information and event listings into one intuitive, real-time hub, helping students make the most of their limited free time while giving clubs a better way to share updates and reach their community.

## Technical Approach
The frontend is built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, creating a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate interface. The backend uses **Node.js** and **Supabase**, which allows secure, real-time updates and reliable database management. The app is hosted on **Vercel** for scalability and continuous deployment, while **GitHub** manages version control and collaborative development. **Google OAuth** integration ensures secure sign-in using CSUN credentials, and role-based access allows club officers to manage events without compromising data integrity.

## Purpose and Features

## Relevance to Hackathon Category
This project is a strong fit for the **Hack for Social Connection** category because its primary goal is to enhance how students discover, connect, and engage with campus communities. Students often face fragmented communication across multiple platforms, which makes joining clubs and attending events difficult, especially for those balancing academics, work, and commuting.  

Club Connect addresses this challenge by centralizing club information and events into a single, accessible platform, making it faster and easier for students to find opportunities that align with their interests. By improving visibility for clubs and simplifying student engagement, the platform strengthens peer-to-peer connections and encourages participation in campus life. Unlike solutions focused solely on infrastructure or administration, Club Connect is specifically designed to foster meaningful social connections among students, making it a natural and strong fit for this category.
